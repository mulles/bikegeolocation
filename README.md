# bikegeolocation

**Goal: building a** 

		-small device: 3x3cm
		-low energy: last 1 year on 18650  (1xlithium laptop cell) 
		-cheap under 15â‚¬ 
		-tracks the position of your bike anytime it1s moving.  
							
							
![Hardware_Setup](https://github.com/mulles/bikegeolocation/blob/master/Hardware_Setup.jpg)								 
**Software:** see this repositories (libraries need to be added in Arduino IDE)


**Hardware:** 

	-ESP8266 Breakoutboard: Wemos D1 
	-RFM95 (lorawan modul)
	-Lithium Batt Shield for WemosD1
	-Antenna on wifi on Lorawan
	-1x 18650 Batt ca 3000mAh @ 3.7V (20uA sleep
          

**Techniques used:** 

		-Lorawan
		-Wlan
		-C 
		-Email 
		future: mqqt

**Setup/Configure:** Import library https://github.com/ArduinoHannover/ESPMailer 
       Search for "fillout" in WifiScanMail.ino and complete the fields
		
    
            
**Roadmap:**

	1.Get the IBM lib running 
	2.base this readme on a standart 
	3.but links for hardware stuff
	4.add sources 
	5.creat wiki with all the knownledge I aquired and the why I decided to got that or an other road. Try to do this always 	       straight away so it is in chronological order.
