Goal: building a
								 -small device: 3x3cm
                 -low energy: last 1 year on 18650 (1xlithium laptop cell)
                 -cheap under 15â‚¬ 
               
Software: see this repositories (libraries need to be added in Arduino IDE)


Hardware: 
					-ESP8266 Breakoutboard: Wemos D1 
          -RFM95 (lorawan modul)
          -Lithium Batt Shield for WemosD1
          -Antenna
          -1x 18650 Batt 
          

Techniques used: 

                -Lorawan
                -Wlan
                -C 
                -Email 
                future: mqqt,
    
            
Roadmap: 

1.Get the IBM lib running 
2.base this readme on a standart 
3.but links for hardware stuff
4.add sources 
5.creat wiki with all the knownledge I aquired and the why I decided to got that or an other road. Try to do this always straight away so it is in chronological order.
